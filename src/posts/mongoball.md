Mongoball is a tool for downloading and consolidating MLB baseball data from multiple sources - [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org/) (play-by-play events, game logs, rosters), [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) (Statcast pitch tracking), and the [SABR Lahman Database](https://sabr.org/lahman-database/) (historical stats, awards, salaries, Hall of Fame). It migrates this data into [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) with a unified schema, enabling rich queries across 150+ years of baseball history. The end-to-end workflow handles downloading, transformation, and verification with a single command.

### Reference Data

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `biofile0.csv` | All players/managers/umpires: ID, name, birth/death, debut dates |
| `ballparks0.csv` | Park codes with name, city, state, and date range |
| `teams0.csv` | Historical franchise codes |

| `coaches0.csv` | Coaching assignments |
| `umpires0.csv` | Umpire career records |
| `ejections.csv` | All ejections: game ID, date, ejectee, umpire, reason |

## Key Relationships

```
Player ID (e.g., "stris002")
    ├── biofile0.csv           → biographical info
    ├── XXX{YEAR}.ROS          → team roster
    ├── {YEAR}batting.csv      → daily batting stats
    ├── {YEAR}pitching.csv     → daily pitching stats
    └── {YEAR}fielding.csv     → daily fielding stats

Game ID (e.g., "TEX202311010")
    ├── gl{YEAR}.txt           → game summary
    ├── {YEAR}XXX.EVA/EVN      → play-by-play
    ├── {YEAR}.EBA/EBN         → box score events
    └── {YEAR}gameinfo.csv     → game metadata

Retrosheet ↔ Statcast Link
    └── chadwick_register.csv  → key_retro ↔ key_mlbam
```

## Linking Retrosheet to Statcast

Use the Chadwick crosswalk to link Retrosheet player IDs to Statcast data:

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { parse } from 'csv-parse/sync';

// Load crosswalk
const xwalk = parse(readFileSync('chadwick_register.csv'), { columns: true });

// Get MLBAM ID for a Retrosheet player
const player = xwalk.find(p => p.key_retro === 'stris002');
const mlbamId = player?.key_mlbam; // "675911"

// Now use mlbamId to query Statcast data
```

## Position Codes

Used in roster and fielding files:

| Code | Position |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Pitcher |
| 2 | Catcher |
| 3 | First Base |
| 4 | Second Base |
| 5 | Third Base |
| 6 | Shortstop |
| 7 | Left Field |
| 8 | Center Field |
| 9 | Right Field |
| 10 | Designated Hitter |

## MongoDB Migration

Load all data into MongoDB for querying and analysis.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start MongoDB (if using Docker)
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:7

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Migrate a single season
npm run migrate -- --data-dir ./data --years 2023

# Migrate multiple seasons
npm run migrate -- --data-dir ./data --years 2020-2024

# Fresh migration (drop existing data)
npm run migrate -- --data-dir ./data --years 2023 --fresh

# Only load specific collections
npm run migrate -- --years 2023 --collections pitches,games

# Load Lahman data (awards, HOF, salaries)
npm run migrate -- --collections lahman

# Show collection statistics
npm run migrate -- --stats-only
```

### Collections

**Retrosheet/Statcast:**

| Collection | Description | Documents |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| `players` | Player biographical data | ~15,000 total |
| `playerSeasons` | Per-season stats | ~1,500/season |
| `games` | Game summaries | ~2,500/season |
| `pitches` | Statcast pitch-by-pitch | ~730,000/season |
| `rosters` | Team rosters | ~30/season |
| `teams` | Team information | ~30 total |
| `venues` | Ballpark data | ~250 total |
| `ejections` | Ejection records | varies |

**Lahman (use `--collections lahman`):**

| Collection | Description | Documents |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| `hallOfFame` | HOF voting and inductions | ~6,400 |
| `awards` | MVP, Cy Young, ROY, etc. | ~13,000 |
| `awardShares` | Award voting details | ~8,200 |
| `salaries` | Player salaries (1985-2016) | ~26,400 |
| `schools` | College/university reference | ~1,300 |
| `collegePlaying` | Player college attendance | ~17,700 |
| `allStarAppearances` | All-Star game selections | ~6,400 |
| `managers` | Managerial records | ~4,400 |

### Schema Design

Data is normalized with consistent camelCase naming:

```javascript
// Example: Query a pitcher's fastballs
db.pitches.find({
  "pitcher.playerId": 675911,
  "pitch.type": "FF",
  season: 2023
})

// Example: Get a player's season stats
db.playerSeasons.findOne({
  playerId: "stris002",
  season: 2023
})

// Example: Batter vs Pitcher matchup
db.pitches.find({
  "pitcher.playerId": 675911,
  "batter.playerId": 656941,
  season: 2023
})

// Example: Hall of Fame inductees
db.hallOfFame.find({
  inducted: true,
  category: "Player"
})

// Example: MVP award winners
db.awards.find({
  awardId: "MVP",
  yearId: { $gte: 2020 }
})

// Example: Highest paid players in 2016
db.salaries.find({ yearId: 2016 }).sort({ salary: -1 }).limit(10)
```

### Indexes

Indexes are created automatically for common query patterns:

- Pitches by pitcher/batter and season
- Games by date and team
- Players by ID and name
- Pitcher vs batter matchups

## Full Workflow Test

This section walks through the complete end-to-end workflow: download, migrate to MongoDB, and verify with test queries.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 18+** and **npm** installed
2. **MongoDB** running (local or remote)

```bash
# Option A: Start MongoDB with Docker
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:7

# Option B: Use an existing MongoDB instance
export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://user:pass@host:27017"
```

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /path/to/mongoball
npm install
```

### Step 2: Download Data

Download season data (Retrosheet + Statcast) and optionally Lahman:

```bash
# Download 2023 season data (~450 MB for Statcast)
# This may take 5-10 minutes depending on connection speed
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" npm run download -- 2023

# Or include Lahman database (awards, HOF, salaries)
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" npm run download -- 2023 --lahman
```

Verify files were downloaded:

```bash
./scripts/verify-data.sh 2023
```

Expected output:
```
=== Verifying 2023 MLB Data ===
✓ Statcast pitches         732,562 lines
✓ Game logs                  2,430 lines
✓ Event files             15 AL + 15 NL files
✓ Roster files                  30 files
✓ Player ID crosswalk      510,000 lines
```

### Step 3: Migrate to MongoDB

Load data into MongoDB:

```bash
# Basic migration (uses localhost:27017, database: mlb)
npm run migrate -- --years 2023

# With custom MongoDB connection
npm run migrate -- --uri "mongodb://user:pass@host:27017" --database mlb --years 2023

# Fresh migration (drops existing collections first)
npm run migrate -- --years 2023 --fresh

# Include Lahman data
npm run migrate -- --years 2023 --collections players,teams,venues,games,rosters,pitches,ejections,lahman
```

Expected output:
```
Connecting to MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017
Connected to database: mlb

```

### Step 4: Verify with Test Queries

Run 10 automated test queries to validate the data:

```bash
# Basic verification
npm run verify -- --year 2023

# With custom MongoDB connection
npm run verify -- --uri "mongodb://user:pass@host:27017" --database mlb --year 2023
```

Expected output:
```

### One-Command Workflow

Alternatively, run everything with a single command:

```bash
# Full workflow: download, migrate, verify
./scripts/full-workflow.sh 2023

# With Lahman data
./scripts/full-workflow.sh 2023 --with-lahman

# With custom MongoDB and fresh start
./scripts/full-workflow.sh 2023 --with-lahman --fresh --uri "mongodb://user:pass@host:27017"
```

### Test Queries Explained

| # | Test | What It Validates |
|---|------|-------------------|
| 1 | Players collection | Chadwick crosswalk loaded correctly |
| 2 | Games for year | Retrosheet game logs parsed |
| 3 | Pitches (Statcast) | Statcast CSV streamed and loaded |
| 4 | Rosters | Team roster files parsed |
| 5 | Teams | Static team data loaded |
| 6 | Pitch type distribution | Aggregation pipeline works |
| 7 | Home run leaders | Complex query with batted ball data |
| 8 | Hall of Fame | Lahman HOF data loaded |
| 9 | Awards | Lahman awards loaded with denormalization |
| 10 | Salaries | Lahman salary data with max query |

### Troubleshooting

**Statcast download fails or runs out of memory:**
```bash
# Increase Node.js heap size
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" npm run download -- 2023
```

**MongoDB connection refused:**
```bash
# Check if MongoDB is running
docker ps | grep mongo

# Or start it
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:7
```

**Verification shows 0 documents:**
```bash
# Check if migration completed
npm run migrate -- --stats-only

# Re-run migration with fresh flag
npm run migrate -- --years 2023 --fresh
```
