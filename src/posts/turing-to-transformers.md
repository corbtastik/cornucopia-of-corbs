## The Imitation Game

The story of Artificial Intelligence doesn't begin with a microchip, but with a question. In 1950, **Alan Turing** published a paper titled *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*, in which he posed the famous question: *"Can machines think?"*

He proposed the **Turing Test**, a criterion for intelligence: if a human interacting with a machine cannot distinguish it from another human, the machine is said to be intelligent.

## The Rollercoaster: Summers and Winters

The term "Artificial Intelligence" was officially coined at the **Dartmouth Workshop in 1956**. The optimism was intoxicating. Researchers believed a machine as intelligent as a human would exist within a generation.

They were wrong.

### The Timeline of Evolution

*   **1950s-60s (The Golden Years):** Early programs like ELIZA (a chatbot) and checkers-playing algorithms showed promise. Logic and rules were the primary tools.
*   **1970s-80s (The AI Winter):** Funding dried up. The "rules-based" approach hit a wall; computers couldn't handle the ambiguity of the real world.
*   **1997:** IBM's **Deep Blue** defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov. It was brute force, not "thinking," but it was a milestone.
*   **2010s (Deep Learning):** The availability of massive data (Big Data) and GPUs allowed Neural Networks to flourish. Systems could finally "see" (Computer Vision) and "hear" (Speech Recognition).

## The Transformer Revolution (2017–Present)

Everything changed in 2017 with a paper from Google titled *"Attention Is All You Need."* This introduced the **Transformer architecture**.

Unlike previous models that read text sequentially (left to right), Transformers could pay "attention" to entire sentences at once, understanding context and nuance. This architecture paved the way for **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like BERT, Claude, and GPT.

Suddenly, AI wasn't just classifying images; it was *generating* poetry, code, and art.

## What's Next? (2026 and Beyond)

As we stand here in late 2025, the "Chatbot" era is arguably peaking. We are moving from AI that *talks* to AI that *acts*.

### 1. Agentic AI
The next massive shift is **Agents**. Instead of you typing a prompt and getting text back, you will give an Agent a goal: *"Plan a trip to Tokyo for under $3,000."*
The AI will autonomously browse the web, compare flights, book hotels, and add dates to your calendar—looping until the task is complete.

### 2. Embodied AI
Brain, meet Body. We are seeing the rapid convergence of LLMs and Robotics. Robots are no longer being hard-coded to pick up a box; they are being *taught* via vision and language models to navigate complex, messy human environments.

### 3. Reasoners
Models are moving from pattern matching to **System 2 Thinking**—slow, deliberate reasoning. We are seeing models that can pause, "think" through a math problem step-by-step, verify their own work, and correct errors before responding.

The history of AI is a history of moving the goalposts. Once a machine can do it, we stop calling it AI and just call it "software." But the next decade promises to blur that line until it vanishes completely.
