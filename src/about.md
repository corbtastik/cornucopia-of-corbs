## Howdy all!

I’m Corbett Martin. I work at MongoDB as an Advisory Solutions Architect, where I help large enterprises modernize how they build and run data-driven applications. My day-to-day is a mix of technical strategy and hands-on engineering: translating business goals into practical architectures, guiding teams through migrations and platform decisions, and building proof-of-concepts that show what “good” looks like in the real world.

A big part of my work centers on operational excellence at scale: automation, repeatable delivery patterns, and designing systems that stay reliable as workloads and teams grow. Lately, that also means helping people connect data platforms to AI workflows.

I studied at Southern Methodist University and the University of Texas at Arlington (CS in both cases).

I have a developer background and mess about on GitHub ([corbtastik](https://github.com/corbtastik)).
