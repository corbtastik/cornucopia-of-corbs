## Hi, I'm You.

I am a full-stack developer, dog enthusiast, and digital explorer. I built this site to share my learnings on **11ty**, **Web Development**, and the history of technology.

### What I Do

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Sass/PostCSS), JavaScript (Vanilla/React)
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Java, Kotlin
*   **Database:** MongoDB (is there anything else?)
*   **Vibe:** 100%

### My Philosophy

> "Code is poetry written for machines to read and humans to understand."

I believe in the open web, fast load times, and accessible design. This blog is my playground for testing new ideas (like the theme switcher you see up top!).
